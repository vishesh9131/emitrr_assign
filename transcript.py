DEFAULT="""Physician: Good morning, Ms. Jones. How are you feeling today?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. I'm doing better, but I still have some discomfort now and then.
Physician: I understand you were in a car accident last September. Can you walk me through what happened?
Patient: Yes, it was on September 1st, around 12:30 in the afternoon. I was driving from Cheadle Hulme to Manchester when I had to stop in traffic. Out of nowhere, another car hit me from behind, which pushed my car into the one in front.
Physician: That sounds like a strong impact. Were you wearing your seatbelt?
Patient: Yes, I always do.
Physician: What did you feel immediately after the accident?
Patient: At first, I was just shocked. But then I realized I had hit my head on the steering wheel, and I could feel pain in my neck and back almost right away.
Physician: Did you seek medical attention at that time?
Patient: Yes, I went to Moss Bank Accident and Emergency. They checked me over and said it was a whiplash injury, but they didn't do any X-rays. They just gave me some advice and sent me home.
Physician: How did things progress after that?
Patient: The first four weeks were rough. My neck and back pain were really badâ€”I had trouble sleeping and had to take painkillers regularly. It started improving after that, but I had to go through ten sessions of physiotherapy to help with the stiffness and discomfort.
Physician: That makes sense. Are you still experiencing pain now?
Patient: It's not constant, but I do get occasional backaches. It's nothing like before, though.
Physician: That's good to hear. Have you noticed any other effects, like anxiety while driving or difficulty concentrating?
Patient: No, nothing like that. I don't feel nervous driving, and I haven't had any emotional issues from the accident.
Physician: And how has this impacted your daily life? Work, hobbies, anything like that?
Patient: I had to take a week off work, but after that, I was back to my usual routine. It hasn't really stopped me from doing anything.
Physician: That's encouraging. Let's go ahead and do a physical examination to check your mobility and any lingering pain.
[Physical Examination Conducted]
Physician: Everything looks good. Your neck and back have a full range of movement, and there's no tenderness or signs of lasting damage. Your muscles and spine seem to be in good condition.
Patient: That's a relief!
Physician: Yes, your recovery so far has been quite positive. Given your progress, I'd expect you to make a full recovery within six months of the accident. There are no signs of long-term damage or degeneration.
Patient: That's great to hear. So, I don't need to worry about this affecting me in the future?
Physician: That's right. I don't foresee any long-term impact on your work or daily life. If anything changes or you experience worsening symptoms, you can always come back for a follow-up. But at this point, you're on track for a full recovery.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate it.
Physician: You're very welcome, Ms. Jones. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."""

CHUNK_A = """Doctor: Good morning, how are you feeling today?
Patient: Not very well, doctor. I've been having chest pain for the past two days.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the pain?
Patient: It's a sharp pain, right in the center of my chest. Sometimes it spreads to my left arm.
Doctor: Does the pain come and go, or is it constant?
Patient: It comes and goes. It's worse when I exert myself.
Doctor: Any shortness of breath or dizziness?
Patient: Yes, I get short of breath when walking up stairs, and I felt dizzy yesterday.
Doctor: Have you had any previous heart problems?
Patient: My father had a heart attack at 60, but I've never had any issues before.
Doctor: I'm going to order an ECG and some blood tests. This could be angina, which is chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart.
Patient: Is that serious?
Doctor: It can be, but there are effective treatments. I'm also going to prescribe nitroglycerin tablets for you to take when you feel the chest pain.
Patient: Thank you, doctor.

Doctor: How often have you been able to pass stool?
Patient: Only once in the past four days, and it was very hard and difficult to pass.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or blood in the stool?
Patient: No vomiting, but I do feel a bit nauseous. There's no blood.
Doctor: Have you changed your diet recently or been under stress?
Patient: Not really, but I've been eating more fast food and drinking less water.
Doctor: It sounds like you're dealing with constipation, likely due to diet and dehydration. I recommend increasing your fiber intake, drinking plenty of water, and exercising regularly. If needed, I can prescribe a mild laxative.
Patient: How long will it take to improve?
Doctor: If you follow these recommendations, you should feel better within a few days. Let me know if symptoms persist.

Doctor: Do you have any fever, sore throat, or difficulty breathing?
Patient: No fever, but my throat feels irritated, and I feel tired.
Doctor: Do you have any history of allergies or asthma?
Patient: No, doctor. But I do live in an area with a lot of air pollution.
Doctor: This could be due to allergies or pollution-related irritation. I'll prescribe a cough syrup and an antihistamine. Try to avoid dust and smoke.
Patient: Should I be worried?
Doctor: If symptoms persist beyond another week, we may need to do further tests. For now, take rest and stay hydrated.

Doctor: Any loss of appetite, dizziness, or unusual weight changes?
Patient: I've lost a little weight, and I feel dizzy sometimes.
Doctor: Have you been tested for anemia before?
Patient: No, but my mother had low iron levels before.
Doctor: This could be iron deficiency anemia. I'll recommend a blood test to confirm and prescribe iron supplements.

Patient: Oh, I'm Dr. Patel, but I'm the patient today, not the doctor. Anil Patel.
Doctor: Thank you, Dr. Patel. Can you describe the pain in more detail?
Patient: It's a sharp, shooting pain that radiates from my lower back down my left leg. Sometimes there's numbness and tingling in my foot.
Doctor: That sounds like it could be sciatica or a herniated disc. Have you had any injuries or do heavy lifting?
Patient: I lift patients occasionally in my practice, but no specific injury I can recall.
Doctor: I'd like to order an MRI to get a better look at what's happening. In the meantime, I'll prescribe a muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory medication.
Patient: Is this something that might require surgery?
Doctor: It's too early to tell without the imaging, but many cases respond well to physical therapy and medication. Surgery is typically a last resort.
Patient: That's a relief. When should I expect improvement?
Doctor: With proper treatment, you should notice improvement within 2-3 weeks. If the MRI shows a significant herniation, we might need to consider epidural steroid injections.
Patient: Thank you for your help.
Doctor: You're welcome, Dr. Patel. I'll have my staff schedule that MRI as soon as possible.

CHUNK_R = """Doctor: Hello there. How can I help you today?

Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me your name please?
Patient: My name is Serious Lee-Wong.
Doctor: Thank you, Mr. Lee-Wong. Can you describe the headaches in more detail?
Patient: They typically start at the back of my head and move forward. The pain is throbbing and sometimes I see flashing lights before they begin. They last for hours, sometimes up to a day.
Doctor: Do you have any nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light during these episodes?
Patient: Yes to all three. I often have to lie down in a dark room until they pass.
Doctor: Have you had any changes in vision, balance problems, or confusion during these headaches?
Patient: No confusion or balance issues, but my vision gets blurry during the worst episodes.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, this sounds like migraine with aura. I'd like to rule out other possibilities though. Have you had any recent head injuries or changes in medication?
Patient: No injuries, and I'm not on any regular medication.
Doctor: I'm going to order a brain MRI to rule out any structural causes, and I'll prescribe a triptan medication to take when you feel a headache coming on. I also want you to start keeping a headache diary to identify potential triggers.
Patient: Is this something I'll have to deal with long-term?
Doctor: Migraines are often chronic, but with proper management, many people can reduce their frequency and severity significantly. We might also consider preventive medications if they're occurring frequently.
Patient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
Doctor: You're welcome, Mr. Lee-Wong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
"""

CHUNK_S = """Doctor: Good afternoon. What seems to be troubling you today?
Patient: I've been having chest discomfort and shortness of breath for the past week.
Doctor: That sounds concerning. Before we continue, may I have your name?
Patient: My name is Angina Pectoris.
Doctor: Thank you, Ms. Pectoris. Can you describe the chest discomfort? Is it pain, pressure, or something else?
Patient: It feels like pressure or squeezing in the center of my chest. It usually happens when I'm walking up stairs or exercising, and goes away when I rest.
Doctor: How long does this discomfort typically last?
Patient: About 5-10 minutes after I stop exerting myself.
Doctor: Do you have any history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
Patient: My blood pressure has been high at my last few check-ups, and my father had a heart attack at age 55.
Doctor: Given your symptoms and risk factors, I'm concerned about possible coronary artery disease. This pattern of chest discomfort with exertion that resolves with rest is classic for angina pectoris, which is chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.
Patient: That sounds serious. Is that why my parents named me Angina?
Doctor: Your name is quite coincidental given your symptoms. I'd like to perform an ECG right now and then schedule you for a stress test. I'm also going to prescribe nitroglycerin tablets to take if you experience chest discomfort.
Patient: Will I need surgery or something?
Doctor: It's too early to say. If tests confirm coronary artery disease, treatment options range from medication to angioplasty or bypass surgery, depending on the severity. But first, let's confirm the diagnosis.
Patient: Thank you for taking this seriously.
Doctor: Of course, Ms. Pectoris. Heart symptoms always warrant immediate attention. Please make sure to take the nitroglycerin as directed, and if your chest discomfort lasts longer than 15-20 minutes or is accompanied by sweating, nausea, or jaw pain, please go to the emergency room immediately.
"""

CHUNK_T="""Physician: Good morning, Mr. Thompson. I see you've been feeling fatigued and dizzy lately. Can you describe what's been going on?
Patient: Good morning, doctor. Yes, I've been feeling exhausted for months now. Even after a full night's sleep, I wake up tired. I also get dizzy spells, especially when I stand up too fast.
Physician: I see. Have these symptoms been getting worse over time, or have they been about the same?
Patient: I'd say they're slowly getting worse. A few months ago, I was just a little tired, but now I feel like I don't have any energy most of the day.
Physician: Have you noticed any other symptoms? Maybe headaches, blurred vision, palpitations, or weight changes?
Patient: Wellâ€¦ I do get headaches sometimes, but I figured it was just stress. And now that you mention it, I've lost about 5 kilograms in the past two months, but I haven't changed my diet.
Physician: That's something to note. Have you had any fevers, night sweats, or unusual bruising?
Patient: No fever or night sweats. But I did notice a few random bruises on my arms and legs. I assumed I just bumped into things.
Physician: Okay, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any known conditionsâ€”diabetes, hypertension, thyroid issues?
Patient: No, none of those. I've always been pretty healthy.
Physician: And any recent illnesses or infections?
Patient: I had a mild flu about two months ago, but nothing serious.
Physician: Do you drink alcohol or smoke?
Patient: I have an occasional drink, maybe once a week. Never smoked.
Physician: That's good. What about your dietâ€”do you get enough iron-rich foods, or have you had any changes in appetite?
Patient: I think I eat fairly well. Though I have been feeling less hungry than usual.
Physician: How about stress levelsâ€”anything in your life that could be affecting your sleep or energy?
Patient: Work has been stressful lately, but nothing extreme.
Physician: Understood. Based on your symptomsâ€”fatigue, dizziness, weight loss, and bruisingâ€”there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be something as simple as anemia or vitamin deficiencies, but we also need to rule out more serious conditions like diabetes, thyroid issues, or even bone marrow disorders.
Patient: Bone marrow disorders? That sounds seriousâ€¦
Physician: I don't want to alarm you, but we need to be thorough. Some conditions, like aplastic anemia or leukemia, can cause unexplained fatigue and bruising. But it could also be something far less serious, like low iron levels or chronic fatigue syndrome. That's why we need tests.
Patient: What kind of tests?
Physician: We'll start with a full blood panel, including a complete blood count (CBC), iron levels, vitamin B12, and thyroid function tests. Depending on the results, we may need further testing.
Patient: I see. And what happens if something serious shows up?
Physician: If the blood tests suggest anything concerning, we'll move forward with additional tests like a bone marrow biopsy or imaging scans. But let's not jump ahead. First, we check your blood, and then we go from there.
Patient: Alright, that makes sense.
Physician: I'll have the nurse draw your blood, and we should have results within a few days. Try to take it easy, stay hydrated, and let me know if your symptoms worsen.
Patient: Thanks, doctor. I just hope it's nothing too serious.
Physician: That's completely understandable. We'll figure it out together.
"""
CHUNK_U="""
Physician: Good afternoon. I see you've been experiencing some unusual symptoms. Can you tell me what's been happening?
Patient: Uhâ€¦ yeah. It's just some random stuff. Nothing serious, probably.
Physician: I understand, but I'd like to get a clear picture. What exactly have you noticed?
Patient: Wellâ€¦ sometimes my muscles twitch. Like, my arms and legs will jerk a little, mostly when I'm sitting still. And lately, my left leg has felt kinda weak.
Physician: I see. When did this start?
Patient: Not sure. A few months ago, maybe? It's hard to say.
Physician: And has it been getting worse?
Patient: Uhâ€¦ yeah, I guess. The twitches used to be just in my arms, but now they happen all over.
Physician: What about the weakness in your leg? Do you feel it more at certain times, like after walking for a while?
Patient: Sometimes. But other days, it's fine.
Physician: Have you had any other symptoms? Numbness, vision changes, difficulty swallowing?
Patient: No. Wellâ€¦ actually, sometimes I forget words when I'm talking. Like, simple words. But I'm probably just tired.
Physician: That's important to note. Have you noticed any trouble with coordination or balance?
Patient: Maybe? I tripped last week, but that could've been clumsiness.
Physician: Have you had any recent infections, fever, or unusual stress?
Patient: No fever. I mean, work is stressful, but it always is.
Physician: Any family history of neurological diseases?
Patient: Uhâ€¦ not really.
Physician: Not really? Can you think of any conditions your relatives have had?
Patient: Well, my uncle had somethingâ€¦ I don't remember what it was called. Some disease that made him shake a lot. But he was old.
Physician: That's useful information. Have you noticed any changes in your handwriting or fine motor skills?
Patient: Now that you mention itâ€¦ yeah. Writing feels weird, like my hand doesn't listen to me sometimes.
Physician: Have you seen any other doctors for this?
Patient: Yeah, but they just said it was stress.
Physician: I see. What's your name again?
Patient: Uhâ€¦ Sam.
Physician: And your last name?
Patient: Sam's fine.
Physician: Alright, Sam. Based on what you're describingâ€”muscle twitching, occasional weakness, memory lapses, and handwriting issuesâ€”I'd like to rule out some neurological conditions.
Patient: Like what?
Physician: It could be something as mild as vitamin deficiencies or stress-related muscle spasms. But we also need to consider conditions like ALS, multiple sclerosis (MS), or early-onset Parkinson's disease.
Patient: ALS? That'sâ€¦ serious, right?
Physician: It can be, but it's far too early to jump to conclusions. Many conditions can cause similar symptoms, including things as simple as an electrolyte imbalance or thyroid issues.
Patient: What do we do now?
Physician: I'd like to run a few tests:
	â€¢	Blood tests to check vitamin levels, thyroid function, and markers for autoimmune diseases.
	â€¢	Electromyography (EMG) to examine muscle activity.
	â€¢	MRI scan to check for neurological abnormalities.
Patient: And if the tests show something bad?
Physician: Then we'll figure it out together. The most important thing is getting answers so we can act early if needed.
Patient: â€¦Alright. Let's do the tests.

TEST_CHUNK_A = """Doctor: Good morning, what brings you in today?
Patient: John Smith: I've been experiencing severe lower back pain for the past week.
Doctor: I see. Can you describe the pain in more detail?
Patient: It's a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when I bend over or sit for too long.
Doctor: Have you had any injuries or done any strenuous activities recently?
Patient: I helped my friend move some furniture last weekend. I felt fine that day, but woke up in pain the next morning.
Doctor: That could definitely be the cause. Any numbness or tingling in your legs?
Patient: No, just the pain in my lower back.
Doctor: Based on your description, this sounds like a muscle strain. I'll prescribe some anti-inflammatory medication and recommend rest for a few days.
Patient: How long until I feel better?
Doctor: With proper rest and medication, you should start feeling improvement within 3-5 days.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_B = """Doctor: Hello there, how can I help you today?
Patient: I've been having these terrible migraines, doctor.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you tell me your name first?
Patient: Oh, I'm Jennifer Lopez-Garcia.
Doctor: Thank you, Ms. Lopez-Garcia. How long have you been experiencing these migraines?
Patient: For about three months now, and they're getting more frequent.
Doctor: Do you notice any triggers or warning signs before they start?
Patient: Yes, I often see flashing lights and feel nauseous about an hour before the pain starts.
Doctor: That sounds like migraine with aura. I'll prescribe medication and recommend keeping a headache diary.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_C = """Doctor: Next patient please. What seems to be the problem?
Patient: Doctor, my name is James O'Connor and I've been having chest pains.
Doctor: When did these pains start, Mr. O'Connor?
Patient: About two weeks ago. They come and go, mostly when I'm stressed.
Doctor: Do you have any history of heart problems in your family?
Patient: My father had a heart attack at 50, and my grandfather died from one.
Doctor: Given your symptoms and family history, I'd like to run some tests right away.
Patient: Is it serious?
Doctor: We need to rule out any cardiac issues. Let's not take chances with chest pain.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_D = """Doctor: Good afternoon. Who am I speaking with today?
Patient: Good afternoon. My throat has been really sore for days.
Doctor: I'll help you with that. Could you please state your name for our records?
Patient: My name is Kim Lee-Wong.
Doctor: Thank you, Ms. Lee-Wong. How long has your throat been bothering you?
Patient: About five days now. It hurts to swallow and I've had a low fever.
Doctor: Let me take a look... Yes, your throat is quite inflamed. This appears to be strep throat.
Patient: Is that serious?
Doctor: It's a bacterial infection that requires antibiotics. You should feel better within 48 hours of starting treatment.

TEST_CHUNK_E = """Doctor: Hello, what can I do for you today?
Patient: I've been feeling extremely tired lately, no matter how much I sleep.
Doctor: I understand. Before we continue, may I have your name?
Patient: It's Thomas O'Reilly-Johnson.
Doctor: Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly-Johnson. When did this fatigue begin?
Patient: About a month ago. I used to be very active, but now I can barely get through the day.
Doctor: Have you noticed any other symptoms like weight loss or increased thirst?
Patient: Now that you mention it, I have been drinking a lot more water than usual.
Doctor: I'd like to run some blood tests to check for several conditions, including diabetes and thyroid issues.

Patient: Not great, doctor. I've had this persistent cough that won't go away.
Doctor: I see. And your name is?
Patient: Abdul al-Farsi.
Doctor: How long have you been coughing, Mr. al-Farsi?
Patient: For about three weeks now. It's worse at night and early morning.
Doctor: Are you coughing up anything?
Patient: Yes, yellowish phlegm, especially in the morning.
Doctor: This sounds like bronchitis. I'll prescribe antibiotics and recommend plenty of fluids and rest.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_G = """Doctor: Next please. What brings you to the clinic today?
Patient: Hello doctor, I'm experiencing severe joint pain in my hands.
Doctor: I see. Could you tell me your name?
Patient: I'm Mary-Kate Williams.
Doctor: Thank you, Ms. Williams. How long have you had this pain?
Patient: For several months, but it's gotten much worse recently. My fingers are stiff and swollen in the mornings.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, this could be rheumatoid arthritis. We'll need to run some blood tests to confirm.
Patient: Is there a cure?
Doctor: While there's no cure, we have very effective treatments to manage the symptoms and slow progression.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_H = """Doctor: Good afternoon. What seems to be the problem?
Patient: I've been having dizzy spells for the past week.
Doctor: That must be concerning. Could you state your name please?
Patient: Jean-Claude Van Damme.
Doctor: Thank you, Mr. Van Damme. Can you describe these dizzy spells?
Patient: The room seems to spin, and I feel like I might fall. It lasts for about a minute each time.
Doctor: Have you noticed any hearing changes or ringing in your ears?
Patient: Yes, my right ear feels full, and there's a constant ringing.
Doctor: This sounds like vertigo, possibly due to an inner ear issue. Let's run some tests to determine the exact cause.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_I = """Doctor: Hello, how can I help you today?
Patient: Doctor, I've been having trouble sleeping for weeks now.
Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. What's your name?
Patient: D'Angelo Washington.
Doctor: Mr. Washington, can you tell me more about your sleep issues?
Patient: I lie awake for hours before falling asleep, and then wake up multiple times during the night.
Doctor: Have there been any recent changes or stressors in your life?
Patient: I started a new job with irregular hours about a month ago.
Doctor: Your insomnia is likely related to your disrupted sleep schedule. Let's discuss some sleep hygiene techniques and possibly a short-term sleep aid.
"""

TEST_CHUNK_J = """Doctor: Good morning, who do I have the pleasure of seeing today?
Patient: Good morning. I'm experiencing numbness in my right hand.
Doctor: I see. And your name is?
Patient: Sarah O'Malley-Jenkins.
Doctor: Thank you, Ms. O'Malley-Jenkins. How long have you had this numbness?
Patient: About two weeks. It's mainly in my thumb and first two fingers.
Doctor: That distribution suggests carpal tunnel syndrome. Do you do repetitive hand movements at work?
Patient: Yes, I'm a computer programmer. I type all day.
Doctor: Let's do some tests to confirm, but we'll likely need to discuss ergonomic changes and possibly a wrist brace.
